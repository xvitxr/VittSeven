Hello, my name is Vitor Monteiro. I'm a teenager (14) from Brazil (Paran√°, Curitiba).

I know the fallowing programming languages...

C# (yeah i know a bunch things)
Python (hmm, just some things)
C, C++ (wanna learn)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

I like coding sometimes.
It lights up a flame of creativity in my mind. Programming fascinates me.

It's not all about making ones and zeros interact with each other, 
but making something that will really help someone.
But most importanly, making something that you like.
Don't code just by code, code with passion and determination.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm terribly bad at code
BUT atleast i'm not the worse.

My greatest project it's the 'vitt7console' (awesome name).
I'm putting all i can do in it. Expect only weekly updates.
Still on aplha, but with enough time and effort i sure that i can do something good!
